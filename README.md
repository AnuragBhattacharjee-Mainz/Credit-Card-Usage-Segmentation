<h2><a class="anchor" id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning techniques** to segment credit card customers into meaningful clusters or groups.  
By analyzing their card usage behavior, the model helps financial institutions design targeted strategies for:  
- Personalized offers  
- Customer retention   
- Inactive customers
- Risk management

<h2><a class="anchor" id="Business-Problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Banks and financial institutions need to better understand their customersâ€™ **credit card usage patterns**.  
- The project aims to:  
  - Identify **distinct customer groups** based on spending and repayment behavior  
  - Help in **improving customer satisfaction** with tailored services  
  - Support **marketing campaigns** for specific customer segments  
  - Reward loyal customers, identify and predict **high risk customer**

<h2><a class="anchor" id="dataset"></a>Dataset</h2>

- Dataset used: **Customer Data**  
- Contains customer-level details such as:  
  - Balance, Purchases, Cash Advances  
  - Credit Limit, Payments, Tenure  
  - Purchase frequency & types
  - There are 18 columns in total

<h2><a class="anchor" id="data-cleaning--preparation"></a>Data Cleaning and Preparation</h2>

- Handled missing values  
- Treated outliers and filled missing values based on median 
- Standardized numerical features using **StandardScaler**  
- Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction
- Applied t-SNE method on dataset in 2 Dimension 

---

<h2><a class="anchor" id="Exploratory-Data-Analysis-eda"></a>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

- Distribution analysis of customer spending, balance, and credit usage
- Visualization of dataset for representing the null values using a SNS heatmap  
- Detection of high vs. low spenders, frequent vs. occasional users
- Correlation heatmap of key financial metrics  

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Strong correlation between purchases and OneOff Purchases
- Negative correlation between balance and prc full payment

- **Clustering Algorithm Used**: KMeans  
- **Optimal Number of Clusters** chosen using:  
  - Elbow Method  
  - Silhouette Score  
  
- **Clustering algorithm used**: Agglomerative
- **Optimal number of clusters** chosen using:
- Silhouette Score

- Other clusturing method used for visulizing datasets: 
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
---

Final Model:  
- Segmented customers into **[4] clusters**  
- Cluster profiles created based on usage patterns and financial behavior

<h2><a class="anchor" id="Key Insights"></a>Key Insights </h2>

-  segment 1 characteristics: High Earners, high spenders, low credit risk customers
-  segment 2 characteristics: Low Balance, high spenders, Percent full payments are low, High risk customers 
-  segment 3 characteristics: Low Balance, low average purchases, low credit utilisation, Inactive customers
-  segment 4 characteristics: Good Balance, good credit ratio, low average purchase amount, potential for more spending

<h2><a class="anchor" id="further-recommendations"></a>Further Recommendations</h2>

---
- The output file "cluster_groupby_values" can be further used to visualise insights of customer segments using BI software
- The output files "Cluster_0" to "Cluster_3" can be used to extract further business insights for each customer group
